CIS175 - Java II
This program provides a user with a background in single malt whiskey flavors, then 
prompts the user to specify which flavors sound more appealing.  The program takes those
answers into account in the form of integers 0-3, then passes those to the Whiskies class
where they are inserted into an array of an array as what are essentially the row and 
column locations of a two dimensional array.  Strings of whiskeys that match the location 
of user input (flavor1 and flavor2) are stored in the arrays and then output to the user
as a suggestion for purchase.  The whiskey flavor information list of whiskeys were borrowed 
from http://drinkwire.liquor.com/post/single-malt-whisky-guide-infographic#gs.84arC7k. All 
credit goes to the original author Alexander A. Woldehanna (aka Intoxicology). I learned a lot
from this information and hope the user will also.
